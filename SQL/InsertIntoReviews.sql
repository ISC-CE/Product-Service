The stuff I want it to do, it does perfectly, and thank Christ it isnt an Apple product $$$. Build quality is just fine with this baby, so save your money, spend it on someone lovely..

I thought he was with Metro PCS so I didn’t think he would have any problems using it. I find out after I gave it to him that they had switched to Xfinity. Uh-Oh this could be a problem. Thankfully this wasn’t the case. He was able to use the same Sim Card for his iphone 8 plus for his Motorola G Stylus 2022. He called Xfinity and they walked him through the process of setting up his phone. It is working great. There are no issues He loves his phone. I took a sneak peak before giving him new phone and it is nice looking phone. It works with Xfinity for those who use this provider.', '11/5/23 2:07');

I bought this phone 3 months ago. In the 1st month, this phone kept freezing up and I had to reboot it approx 8-12 times/day. The flashlight only works once in a while. Its been 3 months now and the phone has slowed down considerably and speaker no longer works. I have never dropped this phone and its never been near water. It looks like brand new and Im offering to sell it for $5 to pay for shipping to get it to you. Any takers? Im a minimum wage girl who takes care of a sick child. I couldnt afford the $150 to begin with. Now Im out $150 and no phone.', '11/5/23 2:07');

I needed a phone first. Since I was paying for 5G (and had a bad experience with Apple), I chose the cheapest Android 5G phone I could buy outright. It was as bland and bloated as an i-device. A month in and I realized I really miss wireless charging, and never really used the stylus. For some reason unknown to me, the phone shut off on 3 different occasions in the middle of the night. I work all hours and need this thing to be always on and working as a phone. It was not from an automatic update (I have those disabled because I need it always on). I dont believe it was thermal shutdown, but it was plugged in charging while I was asleep when it would shut off. Thought Id share my thoughts before I shell out more money for one that works as intended.', '11/5/23 2:07');

But I believe everyone should have access to music. We tried a mp3 player but it was annoying to put music on. And a really good mp3 player is hundreds of dollars. This was a cheap option and has parental controls. Unfortunately she can turn them off, luckily I would be notified. Proved it to her so she knows.
